The xml is well-formed, applying configuration
Database set to PostgreSQL
Changed tpcc:pg_rampup from 2 to 10 for PostgreSQL
Changed tpcc:pg_duration from 5 to 120 for PostgreSQL
Clearing Script, reload script to activate new setting
Script cleared
Changed tpcc:pg_driver from test to timed for PostgreSQL
Changed tpcc:pg_total_iterations from 1000000 to 1000000000 for PostgreSQL
Changed tpcc:pg_raiseerror from false to 1 for PostgreSQL
Changed tpcc:pg_timeprofile from false to true for PostgreSQL
Value false for tpcc:pg_keyandthink is the same as existing value false, no change made
Changed connection:pg_host from localhost to 172.31.40.242 for PostgreSQL
Value 5432 for connection:pg_port is the same as existing value 5432, no change made
Changed tpcc:pg_rampup from 10 to 5 for PostgreSQL
Changed tpcc:pg_duration from 120 to 60 for PostgreSQL
Benchmark set to TPC-C
